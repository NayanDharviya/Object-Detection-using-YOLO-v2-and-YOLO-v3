YOLO, or “You only live once,”

YOLO algorithm is an algorithm based on regression, instead of selecting the interesting part of an Image, it predicts classes and bounding boxes for the whole image in one run of the Algorithm.

YOLO is popular because it achieves high accuracy while also being able to run in real-time. The algorithm “only looks once” at the image in the sense that it requires only one forward propagation pass through the neural network to make predictions

In this repository I used YOLO model to detect custom object like, Person, Car etc.

You can detect any custom object based on your need just used images of the class you want to detect and based on the class change in the configuration(.cfg) file of the YOLO
